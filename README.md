# Saga

Saga is a project intended to ease and modernize the process of inverse logistics in distribution companies of the hospitality indistry. The main idea is using weight to validate the products returned to the warehouse

This project is made as part of the subject [Applied Engineering Project](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/bachelors-degrees/bachelor-degree-informatics-engineering/curriculum/syllabus/PAE) of the [Barcelona School of Informatics](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/)

## The project

Our project has three parts:

- A library with the main logic of the project and the interfaces it needs to work
- An implementation of the library using a Firebase database
- An Android App made using said implementation

Each of these three components is open source and available for dowload as compiled code
